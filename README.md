# Verbeter Je Gemeente (VJG)
This is an Android project that enables citizens of a townhall to report issues (like broken streetlights or broken pavement) through a API based on the [**Open311 Interface**](http://www.open311.org/learn/ "Open311 Interface"). Users are able to explore issues on a WFS and WFS layered map that already have been reported by other users and explore/follow them or report an issue themselves by sending information (like a picture) about the issue. 

Aiming to make some parts of the app offline-first so users can use the app without internet.
